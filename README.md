The Project focuses on performing data analysis on a flight delay dataset obtained from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transphe assortation Statistics (BTS). The dataset contains information about the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers.

The main objective of the Project is to analyze the dataset and gain insights into flight delays. By applying data analysis techniques, we aim to answer questions related to predicting flight delays, understanding the factors influencing delays, and identifying patterns or trends in flight schedules.
